# Intuition

The task is like flipping the order of 0s and 1s in a binary number. To do this, we'll examine each bit (0 or 1) in the input number and construct the reversed number step by step.

# Approach

We start with an answer variable set to 0. Write a for loop that will run 32 times (once for each bit). In the loop we will:

- Move the answer's bits to the left.
ans <<= 1;
- Check if the current bit is 1 and add it to the answer if it is.
ans |= (n & 1);
- Move to the next bit in the given number.
n >>= 1;

After this process, the answer will have the reversed bits.
Complexity

- Time complexity: O(1)
- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
      uint32_t ans = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        ans <<= 1;
        ans |= (n & 1);
        n >>= 1;
      }
      return ans;
    }
};
```
